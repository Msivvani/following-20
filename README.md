# Following'20
Following'20 is an event organized by Robotics and Machine Intelligence club of NIT Trichurapalli for aspiring roboticists
Description of the task:

arena: 
4X4 black lines arranged in form of grid 

PHASE 1:
At the beginning of the task, the bot will be placed at the start node. The 
goal of Phase 1 is to make the bot move to any given node, with coordinates 
(X, Y). The coordinates of the target node can be sent to the bot via any 
wireless means. The bot must travel to the target node.

PHASE 2:
The bot will start from the start node. Shapes printed on an A4 sheet will 
be shown to the laptop camera. Your task is to read and decode the X and Y 
coordinates of the target node from the shapeS.The bot then has to move to the decoded 
target node and wait there until another set of shapes is shown. This will 
specify the next target node.

PHASE 3:
Similar to Phase 2 printed out shapes are shown to the laptop camera to 
decode coordinates. After finding the coordinates while the bot travels to the 
target node obstacles would be randomly places by organisers on the track. 
The bot should be able to detect the obstacle present on the track and reroute 
its path to reach the target node
